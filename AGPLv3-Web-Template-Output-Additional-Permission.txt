       The Web Template Output Additional Permission, Version 0.7
       
This Web Template Output Additional Permission ("Additional Permission") is
an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public
License, version 3 ("AGPLv3"). It applies to all material at the same level
the folder where this Additional Permission is located and below ("the
Package").

1. DEFINITIONS

"Covered Output" means a covered work in the HTML, Javascript, and CSS languages generated by
the Package that are deployed to create a website and distributed publicly.

The "Output Licenses" are, for covered works written in HTML, the Creative Commons
Public Domain Dedication 1.0 Universal or any later version as published by
Creative Commons, Inc. ("CC0"), and, for covered works written in CSS and Javascript,
the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3 or any later version of that
license as published by the Free Software Foundation,
Inc. ("LGPLv3-or-later").

2. GRANT OF ADDITIONAL PERMISSION

You have the following additional permission: the Covered Output is licensed to you
under the Output Licenses provided that Covered Output is comprised only of: (a)
Covered Output generated by the unmodified Package, and/or (b) content that was not
already a covered work.

No additional permission is granted for any covered works that are not HTML,
Javascript nor CSS.

3. NO WEAKENING OF COPYLEFT.

The availability of this Additional Permission does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the AGPLv3 license of this Package.

4.   Revised Versions of this Additional Permission.

The Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc. ("Conservancy") may publish revised
and/or new versions of this Additional Permission from time to time.  Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of this Additional Permission "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by Conservancy.  If the Program does not specify a version number
of this Additional Permission, you may choose any version ever published by
Conservancy.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
this Additional Permission can be used, that proxy's public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
the Program.

Later Additional Permission versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
