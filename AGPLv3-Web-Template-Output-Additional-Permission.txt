      The Web Template Output Additional Permission, Version 0.6

This Web Template Output Additional Permission ("Additional Permission") is
an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public
License, version 3 ("AGPLv3"). It applies to all material licensed under
AGPLv3 included in a repository ("the Package") where this Additional
Permission appears in a file called LICENSE.ADDITIONAL-PERMISSION at the top
directory of the repository.

When you use this Package to create a website, the Package generates HTML,
Javascript, and CSS files which are deployed to create a website and
distributed publicly as part of a deployment.  Files in the HTML, Javascript
or CSS languages that are publicly distributed on a website are considered
"Output" of the Package,

1. GRANT OF ADDITIONAL PERMISSION

You have permission to propagate specific works of Output under terms other
than AGPLv3, as set forth in this section.

If you do not modify the Package, you may propogate, convey, and/or modify
unmodified HTML Output under the terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication 1.0 Universal, or any later version as published by Creative
Commons, Inc. ("CC0"), and unmodified CSS and Javascript Output under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3 or any later version
of that license as published by the Free Software Foundation, Inc
("LGPLv3-or-later").

If you modify the Package, you may propogate, convey, and/or modify any
Output under the respective licensing as specified above for unmodified
Output, provided that such Output includes only Output either generated by
the unmodified Package, and/or additional Output copyrighted by you and/or
seperatedly licensed to you by a third party.

This additional permission never applies to any works that are not HTML,
Javascript nor CSS in any event.

2. NO WEAKENING OF COPYLEFT.

The availability of this Additional Permission does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the AGPLv3 license of this Package.

3.   Revised Versions of this Additional Permission.

The Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc. ("Conservancy") may publish revised
and/or new versions of this Additional Permission from time to time.  Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of this Additional Permission "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by Conservancy.  If the Program does not specify a version number
of this Additional Permission, you may choose any version ever published by
Conservancy.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
this Additional Permission can be used, that proxy's public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
the Program.

Later Additional Permission versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
